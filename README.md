You can run the python file main_for_[METHOD].py to run the expriment for that method and get the submission.csv
in the *submissions2* dir.

For example: `python main_for_SVM.py` for SVM expriment.
Then you can find a new csv file in the *submissions2* dir.

The parameters can be set by args or you can simply modify the code.
